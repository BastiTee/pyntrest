**Cambodia** is one of my all time favorite destinations. It may be a flawed, corrupt, 
barren country, but filled with some of the most amazing people I’ve ever 
encountered, rich history, delicious food, beautiful coastline, and a lively 
nightlife. Cambodia is a country still trying to find its way. Development 
hasn’t been great, as corrupt officials have hindered growth by selling off 
most of the country to investors. But in all my visits here, I always fall 
more madly in love with the place and can’t recommend it enough to everyone 
I meet. It always surprises you. This country guide to Cambodia can help you plan your trip.

### Top Things to See and Do in Cambodia

**Angkor Wat** – This huge temple complex is the reason most people visit Cambodia. The temple ruins are massive, and you’ll need a few days to explore all of them. While there’s a lot more to the country than this UNESCO site (too many people only come to visit Angkor), no trip is complete without satisfying your inner Tomb Raider and exploring these ruins.

**Tongle Sap** – Sailing down this river allows you to get a look at how closely Cambodian life is tied to this major waterway. You can take a boat all the way down one end to the other or just cruise around on a day trip.
